Igloo Score 1:
    -Fixed line 39 so that the correct score is being used 

Igloo Score 2:
    -Fixed line 44 so that the lowest score is not being kept
    -Fixed line 49 and 50 so that if all scores are equal the scores are set to the correct value
    -Fixed line 59 to get rid of testing for null args and instead just checks to make sure there are exactly 3 arguments
